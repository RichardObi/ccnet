## Getting Started

The [Duke Dataset](https://sites.duke.edu/mazurowski/resources/breast-cancer-mri-dataset/) used in this study is available on [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70226903).


- [Scripts](src/bash/): Here you can find the scripts to start trainings and inference runs of AEKL, LDM, and ControlNet.
- [Code](src/python/): Here you can find the code for training, inference and evaluation of the models.
- [Code](src/configs/): Here you can find the configs for training, inference and evaluation of the models.
- [Code](src/configs/): Here you can find the configs for training, inference and evaluation of the models.
- [Data](src/data/): In the LDM_metadata.csv you can find the extracted metadata (e.g. containing scanner and contrast info) that can be input as text into the LDMs and ControlNet


## Fr√©chet Radiomics Distance (FRD)

You can find the FRD repository [here](https://github.com/RichardObi/frd-score). 

Let's get started and calculate the FRD with the code below: 

```
pip install frd-score

python -m frd_score path/to/dataset_A path/to/dataset_B
```
